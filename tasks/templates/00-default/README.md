# <TODO:TITLE>

Status: DRAFT, NOT READY TO SIGN

## Objective

This is the playbook for ... on OP <todo:network>.

_TODO: You can add transactions to this task by calling_
```
just add-transaction <to> <sig> <params>...
```
_where `<to>` is the target contract to call and `<sig>` and `<params>` are
the function signature and params as they should be passed to `cast calldata`.
Example:_
```
just add-transaction 0xAe851f927Ee40dE99aaBb7461C00f9622ab91d60 'setGasConfig(uint256,uint256)' 0 0x010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d273000001db0
```
_The old bundle is backed up._


## Signing and execution

_TODO: choose one of the following options and delete the other._

Please see the signing and execution instructions in [SINGLE.md](../../../SINGLE.md).

Please see the signing and execution instructions in [NESTED.md](../../../NESTED.md).

Your Ledger needs to be connected and unlocked. The Ethereum
application needs to be opened on Ledger with the message "Application
is ready".

## State Validations

Now click on the "State" tab. Verify that:

_TODO: Describe expected state changes and possibly link out to relevant PRs.
[This](../../sep/2-op-extended-pause/README.md#32-validate-correctness-of-the-state-diff)
is a good example of how this can look._

## Continue signing

_TODO: choose one of the following options and delete the other._

At this point you may resume following the signing and execution instructions in section 3.3 of [SINGLE.md](../../../SINGLE.md).

At this point you may resume following the signing and execution instructions in section 3.3 of [NESTED.md](../../../NESTED.md).
